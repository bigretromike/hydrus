			<h3>running from source</h3>
			<p>I write the client and server entirely in <a href="https://python.org">python</a>, which can run straight from source. I don't recommended this for someone who just wants to get the program working, but rather for those who have a general interest or wish to modify the program.</p>
			<h3>what you will need</h3>
			<p>You will need to install python 2.7 and several python modules. The best way to figure it out is just to keep running client.pyw and see what it complains about missing.</p>
			<p>I recently got the client working on Ubuntu 14.04, which required:</p>
			<p><ul>
				<li>sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev</li>
				<li>sudo pip install beautifulsoup4 pyyaml python-potr hsaudiotag PyPDF2 flvlib pafy lz4</li>
				<li>sudo apt-get install python-numpy</li>
				<li>sudo apt-get install python-opencv</li>
				<li>sudo apt-get install python-wxversion</li>
				<li>and installing a recent version of wxPython, which is difficult and best done <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/CheckInstall">like so</a></li>
				<li>If you install wxPython as above and you get missing .so errors, try running 'sudo ldconfig'</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>YMMV. Feel free to email me if you run into trouble or discover any neat tricks.</p>
			<p>OS X 10.9 requires a similar pattern to above, though wx is simpler. I use the cocoa package <a href="http://wxpython.org/download.php#osx">straight from wxPython's site</a>. One user reports that this worked for 10.7:</p>
			<p><ul>
				<li>sudo pip install beautifulsoup4 pyyaml python-potr hsaudiotag PyPDF2 twisted flvlib pafy numpy Pillow lxml lz4</li>
				<li>brew tap homebrew/homebrew-science</li>
				<li>brew install opencv</li>
				<li>export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>For Windows, you can do the same thing with easy_install and pip and module installers. Since it doesn't natively come with Python, you'll probably need to go through a bigger list. You'll find <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">this</a> page very helpful. I have a fair bit of experience with Windows python, so send me a mail if you need help.</a>
			<p>Some people have encountered problems with wxPython 3.0, so you might want to try 2.9.x. Again, YMMV.</p>
			<p>You'll probably want to install Pillow (pip should do it for Linux/OS X, easy_install for Windows) instead of PIL, but go back to PIL if Pillow doesn't work.</p>
			<p>If you want to import videos, you will need to put a static <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> executable in the install_dir/bin directory. Have a look at how I do it in the extractable compiled releases if you can't figure it out. You can either copy the exe from one of those releases, or download the latest build right from the FFMPEG site. I don't include these exes in the source release just because they are so big.</a>
			<p>Once you have everything set up, client.pyw and server.pyw should look for and run off the database files just like the executables.</p>
			<p>I develop hydrus on 64-bit Win 7, so the program is much more stable and reasonable on Windows. I do not have as much experience with Linux or OS X, so I would particularly appreciate your Linux/OS X bug reports and any informed suggestions.</p>
			<h3>my code</h3>
			<p>My nerdism is INFJ, not INTP/J. My coding style is unusual, and everything is pretty much hacked together, but please do look through the source if you are interested in how things work and ask me if you don't understand something.</p>
			<p>I prefer to work alone, so while I am very interested in detailed bug reports or suggestions for good libraries to use, I am not looking for pull requests. Everything is <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/COPYING">WTFPL</a>, though, so feel free to fork and play around with things on your end as much as you like.</p>
